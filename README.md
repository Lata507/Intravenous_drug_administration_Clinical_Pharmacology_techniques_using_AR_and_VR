# Intravenous drug administration clinical Pharmacology techniques using Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are emerging   technologies that have revolutionized clinical pharmacology, particularly in training and improving the precision of intravenous (IV) drug administration. AR and VR provide immersive, interactive environments for medical students and professionals to practice IV drug administration in a risk-free, controlled setting. AR technologies allow real-time visualization of veins and anatomical structures, improving accuracy in needle insertion and drug delivery. VR can simulate complex clinical scenarios like emergencies or difficult patient cases (e.g., collapsed veins), helping professionals develop decision-making skills under pressure. Using AR/VR in pharmacology reduces the need for physical materials and live patients, saving time and costs associated with traditional training methods. 

Intravenous (IV) drug administration is a vital clinical technique used to deliver medication directly into the bloodstream for immediate effects, often in critical care settings. 
However, this procedure requires precision in dosing, technique, and monitoring, and even small errors can result in serious adverse outcomes.To improve the accuracy and safety of IV drug administration, clinical pharmacology is now exploring the use of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies.These advanced tools offer a transformative approach to medical training, real-time assistance, and enhanced decision-making.AR and VR can simulate complex clinical scenarios, aid in real-time visualization of veins for improved injection techniques, and enhance learning through immersive simulations, improving the overall quality of healthcare delivery.

This project focuses on developing an Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)-based training system for intravenous (IV) drug administration. The methodology follows a structured approach, beginning with 3D modeling and AR implementation, and progressing toward  VR system development.
The project is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, using AR/VR technologies to revolutionize clinical pharmacology training.
